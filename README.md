***Hardware Security Module (HSM) with ECC Key Generation

**Introduction
This project is a custom-built Hardware Security Module (HSM) that provides robust and secure cryptographic key management. The HSM integrates Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for efficient key generation, ensuring high security while minimizing computational overhead. This solution is ideal for securing sensitive data in applications requiring low-latency operations.

**Features
ECC-Based Key Generation: The HSM leverages ECC, a cutting-edge cryptographic method known for its strength and efficiency in generating public and private key pairs.
Key Generation Notification: Each key pair is generated with real-time feedback, allowing you to monitor the creation process and confirm the security of your operations.
Public and Private Key Display: After generating an ECC key pair, both the public and private keys are securely displayed, ensuring transparency while maintaining cryptographic integrity.
Seamless UART Communication: Notifications and key data are transmitted through UART for direct integration with other hardware or monitoring tools.

**Why ECC?
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) offers superior security with smaller key sizes, reducing computational load and energy consumption. This makes ECC the perfect choice for embedded systems and resource-constrained environments, where efficiency and security are paramount.

**Usage
Once the project is set up on your hardware, you can initiate key generation by simply running the system. The HSM will automatically:

**Generate a secure ECC key pair.
Notify you via UART once the keys have been successfully created.
Display the public and private keys for verification.


This project is designed to be easily customizable and adaptable to various cryptographic projects, such as web applications, Mobile applications, and Desktop applications, through any communication protocol.
